"In this chapter we learned one of the most basic building blocks of a "
"computer program is the **function**. The first function we are learning "
"about is the ``print`` function, used to output information to the screen. "
"We learned how to use that function by entering and running our first "
"program. As programs don't always work the first try, we learned about "
"**name errors** and **syntax errors**. We learned that code has a style "
"guide called **PEP-8** that defines how code should be formatted. Printing "
"multiple lines is possible using three techniques: multiple print "
"statements, **escape codes**, and **triple-quotes**. We learned that escape "
"codes can also be used to print quotes and tab characters."
