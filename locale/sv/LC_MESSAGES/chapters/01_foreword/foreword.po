"This book teaches programming through creating 2D video games. It covers all"
" the standard topics in a normal first-semester college class, but the "
"projects are games. Video games provide great visual feedback for your code."
" Furthermore, programming can be *fun*."

"I den här boken lär du dig programmera genom att skapa datorspel i 2D. Den "
"behandlar samma delar som en vanlig grundkurs på gymnasiet, men övningarna "
"handlar om spel. Datorspel ger dig utmärkt feedback på din programkod och "
"gör programmeringen roligare."

"Even if programming isn't going to be your main job, as a skill it can still"
" enhance your career. Need an interactive website? Need to crunch sales "

"Även om programmering inte ska bli ditt huvudsakliga arbete, kan "

"dina experiment att sparas automatiskt? Kanske vill du att ditt hem mejlar "
"dig när du glömt stänga garagedörren? Med programmering kan du göra detta "
"och mycket annat."
