"This is one of the first games I programmed on the Apple //e. The game is "
"flexible. I've had students create Star Wars themed versions of this game "
"where you need to ride a wampa across Hoth. It is easy to add sandstorms and"
" other random events to the game to make it more interesting. Even though it"
" is only a text-based game, I've found some students really get into playing"
" it. Once I had a professor come and complain when my students were too loud"
" while playing this game on the \"big screen.\""
